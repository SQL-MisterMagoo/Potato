## Example Templated Component

This repo contains a very basic templated component
that demonstrates how simply this can be done.

It is not a complete working component for use
in production, but the amount of flexibility and 
scope for extension in one page of code is pretty
impressive to me.

Fork the project, run it and check out the samples.

Have a play - see if you can understand the way it 
uses RenderFragment templates.

Feel free to contribute samples/improvements.
